          Of course, we do! The situation of not having a vehicle title can
          occur in many ways. It might be destroyed for whatever reason. In any
          case, we will ask you for additional paperwork to prove ownership even
          if we accept every vehicle without a title.

        <p>
          <Link href={"/"}>Our company</Link> will take care of all the
          paperwork if you decide to sell your car without a title. We will also
          have to walk through the <Link href={"/HowWeWorks"}>process</Link> of
          transferring ownership properly. You will therefore receive a lower
          final offer than if someone else tried to sell the vehicle with a
          title.
